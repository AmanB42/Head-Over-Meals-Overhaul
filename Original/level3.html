<h4><i><u>Ingredients</u></i></h4>

<ul>
  <li>250g of fresh pasta dough (see recipe of pasta in Rotolo di Spinachi recipe)</li>
  <li>150g of wild rocket</li>
  <li>200g of Swiss chard leaves, no stem</li>
  <li>200g of cima di rape (turnip greens or tender stem broccoli)</li>
  <li>250g of fresh ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>75g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 clove, crushed garlic</li>
  <li>8 sage leaves</li>
  <li>50g of unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 tsp of crushed fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar</li>
</ul>  

<h4><i><u>Instructions</u></i></h4>

 <ol>
  <li>For the filling blanch the wild rocket, cima di rape or tender stem broccoli and swiss chard separately. Place in a colander to cool down. When cool, squeeze to extract any excess water. Finely chop, heat a frying pan and add a tbsp of olive oil, 1 clove of crushed garlic and a tsp of ground fennel seeds. Fry for 1 minute then add the chopped greens cook for 3 minutes so there is no moisture left. Cool down and mix together with the fresh ricotta, Parmesan. Check the seasoning and place into a piping bag</li>
  <li>Roll out four pasta sheets 40cm long and 10cm wide. Pipe even amounts of the filling with a gap of 4cm per filling. Spray water over the pasta, then fold over. Using your little fingers make divides between each portion of filling. Cup your hands and press gently over each ravioli, push down to release any excess air. Using a pasta cutter with a zig zag edge,cut the ravioli. Once cut, using you fingers make sure all the edges are sealed.  Repeat this process for each sheet of pasta. Leave the ravioli in a fridge for at least 1 hour</li>
  <li>In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the ravioli until they are al dente and add them to a hot saute pan that has melted butter and sage. Take out the ravioli with a slotted spoon and add a ladle of the pasta water. Cook on a high heat so the pasta is tender but still has a bite but most importantly there is an emulsified sauce. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan and black pepper</li>
